<h2>Golden Revision Tips</h2>
<p>Revision is very important, as it makes you review what you have learnt. You could make notes to prepare for exams. A way to master revision is to <strong>recap each subject covered</strong> that day for about 15-20 minutes. Additionally, while preparing for the test, you can <strong>make sample questions for each topic</strong> with random levels of difficulty (this works the best with Science, RE, History and English). Another awesome tip that some of the Golden Squad uses ourselves is: the Blurt Tip! This means to read and revise your textbooks, a little at a time, then <strong>cover the revision notes and write down everything you remember</strong>. If you missed out something, write it down on your paper with <strong>a different coloured pen</strong>. Also, <strong>highlight the key points</strong> in your textbook and/or revision notes. Why don't you have a fun <strong>mock quiz</strong> with friends and family? And finally, read everything but write it <strong>in your own words so you understand the concept</strong>.</p>

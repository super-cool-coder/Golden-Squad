<h1>Among Us in Real Life</h1>
<p>This is one of our favourite hobbies. We frequently play Among Us in real life, which works as a treat! Here's how we did it:</p>
<section>
<ol>
<li>We made a special emergency button - we used a cylindrical sponge and put it on a flat surface.</li>

<li>By using all of our tablets, we got a untie the ropes game for the electrical task.</li>
<p><img src="images/flow.jpg" alt="Flow Electrical Task"/></p>
<li>Then, we made task cards, crewmate cards, and impostor cards.</li>
<p><img src="images/card.jpg" alt="Crewmate & Imposter Cards"/></p>
<li>We added an additional task called the throw task, to throw 3 pom-poms into the pot, each one ranging from a closer to a further distance</li>
<p><img src="images/throw-task.jpg" alt="Throw Task"/></p>
<li>We made our own admin cards to do that task. For the scanner, there is a box made of paper filled with random mini papers saying 'ACCEPTED', 'TOO FAST' or 'TOO SLOW'. To do the task, you slide the admin card over the box, open it and take out a slip. If it doesn't say accepted, you do it again. And again. And again</li>

<p>We also made admin tasks by using Scratch - like this one:</p>

<li>To sabotage, you can close one of the doors</li>

<li>Or, you could take one of the screen tasks and set it to a 5 min timer and put the volume up.</li>

<li>To stop the sabotage, switch off the timer</li>
<li>We made a MedBay task by standing in the 'scanner' for 10 seconds!</li>

<li>We made even more tasks on laptops and phones - uncover the code tasks, turbo-clicking tasks, and we once even coded a data download task!</li>
</ol>

<p>The first time, it was hard to prepare, but next time, we were ready with our supplies at hand. You could use a walkie talkie to call a dead body report or add additional roles! The minimum amount of players for this game is 4.</p>
<p>This is an Among Us Platformer game called Among Us Omega:</p>

<h1>Meet the Golden Squad</h1>
<p>We are the Golden Squad.</p>
<p>Our names are Umar (cyan), Multazim (black), Radhiya (rose) and Muhsanat (navy).</p>

<h2>Umar - Clever, Loyal Leader</h2>
<p><img class="small" src="images/cyan.jpg" alt="Umar!"/></p>
<p>Umar is the extra-smart leader of the Golden Squad. His Hogwarts House: Gryffindor - for the daring, nerve and chivalry (a.k.a courage). He interacts with everyone in the Golden Squad - his best friend is Multazim. Did you know that he did GCSE papers in Year 6 and got many A*s? He likes Break in Story and Rainbow Friends and always gives a go for everyone to choose a game to play. Contrary to popular beliefs, Umar is an introvert but now is preparing to enter a competition, which he doesn't usually do. At school, his main friends are Uzair, Mutasim and Ayaan Ahmed.</p>

<h2>Multi - He has space for everyone</h2>
<p><img class="small" src="images/black.jpg" alt="Multazim!"/></p>
<p>Multazim (nickname:  Multi) is a special person to everyone. He has unique connections with each Golden Squad member and is like a captain to the team. He helps everyone and everything. He isn't peaceful though. He learnt to run before he could walk! He's a chaos-causer and an ultra hero at the same time! He is amazing at games - sports and online!  Athletic as he is, he is a loyal hard-worker. Maybe that's why he is in Hufflepuff, the Hogwarts house of loyalty and hard-workers! His favourite Roblox game: Bedwars.</p>

<h2>Radhiya - Intelligent Reader</h2>
<p><img class="small" src="images/rose.jpg" alt="Radhiya!"/></p>
<p>Radhiya is a kid who likes to read! Although many expect her to be in the Hogwarts house of clever Ravenclaws, she is a Hufflepuff like Multazim. As the phone she plays her games on is now broken, she reads most of the time and plays temporarily on our accounts. She has earned 2 special trophies: a reading trophy, and a science trophy. Also, she has earned the prize and title: Kindillionare! It's a miracle. She's read 5 million words and will hopefully get a tablet! Her favourite Roblox games are Easy Obby and Colour Block. Her favourite youtuber is Shiloh & Bros, like her brother.</p>

<h2>Muhsanat - The Talented Expert... at Art</h2>
<p><img class="small" src="images/blue.jpg" alt="Muhsanat!"/></p>
<p>Trust me, even though I said she is the art expert, she is the master of knowledge in her class. As the youngest in this group, she is bright, fun and full of ideas. Confusingly, Muhsanat is in Gryffindor like me - Gryffindors are supposed to be extraverts but we are both next-level introverts. She likes to play Break In Story and Murder Mystery 2. Her favourite colour used to be black but now is dark blue/navy. According to many beliefs, Muhsanat is A LOT like me. Well, it is kind of true. But she is an amazingly creative box of fun, and that's all that matters!</p>

<h2>Handpicked best Roblox games to play</h2>
<p><img src="images/games1.jpg" alt="High-Class Games"/></p>
<p>The best games we all agreed on are BedWars, a battling game to get supplies and protect your bed with many kits and unique powers; Rainbow Friends, a horror game where you have a box and are collecting stuff for an unknown figure while avoiding crazy monsters; Break In (Story), a game with an interesting storyline where you need to survive the Purge (a gang of murderers); Murder Mystery 2, sheriff vs. murderer - the innocents are there to survive but it confuses the sheriff - who is the murderer - this game also has better weapons to unlock and trade; and finally, you guessed it, Among Us, do tasks, vote out impostors - kill crewmates, sabotage ship.</p>
<p>Another great game to play is welcome to Bloxburg where you literally do anything - but sadly that needs Robux (an in-game currency for all Roblox experiences) so we don't recommend it for people whose parents don't allow them to buy Robux.<p>

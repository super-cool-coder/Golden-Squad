<p>This is a list of the interesting things the squad is up to:</p>

<h2>Play Roblox altogether</h2>
<p>Roblox is a fun experience with lots of cool games on it. In certain games, you unlock badges which is stored and shown in your roblox account. There are also avatars on Roblox, however, some outfits need Robux. Fortunately, you can download a survey app from Google Play Store to get free money and use that for Robux. As per usual, there is a system that allows you to play with friends and make groups (clubs).</p> 
<p>One of our favourite Roblox games is Break In (Story), which is an adventure game with a storyline. You have to find food and money, go to the grocery store, escape the Purge or fight them. You also need to get into the basement to find weapons and unlock different roles. The four starter roles are the Medic, the Protector, the Stealthy and the Hungry. There are 3 endings: the Good, the Evil and the Final. Various badges are awarded when doing interesting things like hacking into the system to switch on the basement lights or befriending the cat.</p>
<p>Another top-notch Roblox game is BedWars, which has many, many modes, different kits with unique abilities, and a bed to protect. You get iron, emeralds and diamonds to upgrade your base, to get supplies and to get ennchantments. By repairing the enchantments table, you are able to buy a special trait with iron/ emeralds. By breaking someone else's bed, they do not respawn after they get killed/ die. The special lucky block mode involves breaking boxes to get amazing weaponsn from other kits, such as the Jade Hammer, a UFO, a Portable Bridge or a Wizard Staff.</p>
<p>The final Roblox game I will introduce to you is Rainbow Friends - a horror game with fun, colourful characters chasing you to try and kill you. A mysterious figure gives you some tasks to collect blocks, food, fuses and batteries. You are supplied with a box that will hide you from the monsters Blue (strong, but dumb) and Orange (fast, but hungry - if you put food in his base he stops running). However, the monsters Green (blind but long arms and if he touches you he will kill you) and Purple (hides in vents and if he is in one when you walk past he kills you unless you walk through a mysterious set of footsteps - this can only be achieved without your box) have to be escaped without using a box. Thereafter, there is a final leaving party where you have no box and you have to escape Blue and exit the facility.</p>

<h2>Special crafts</h2>
<p>We make amazing crafts and pictures - sometimes with videos but sometimes on our own. Multazim and I (Umar) made a special foldable mini box without a tutorial. We did <strong>random creative folds</strong> and started to see a pattern. We then followed the pattern and made the best ever paper foldable mini box!</p>
<p>Also, we frequently make different types of cards such as a pop-up card, or a pull-out card. We love doing some interesting science experiments - we once made a paper flower bloom - it was awesome!</p>

<h2>Make secret codes</h2>
<p><img src="images/code.jpg" alt="Random Code"/></p>
<p>Multazim and I, and Muhasanat and Radhiya made amazing codes. The first time we made our code, it looked like hieroglyphics - almost indecipherable! I once made a code with some of my other cousins, which I memorised and one with my friend, which I semi-memorised. But me and Multazim made a really OG one. It was an amazing code. I think he still has hold of those papers today! Why don't you make a code?</p>

<h2>Have a sleepover</h2>
<p>This was the best. A chance to spread every fun thing into 3 days!</p>

<h2>Sports/ Play in the park</h2>
<p>We sometimes go just outside Multazim's house and have a kick-about while the girls played with skipping ropes. We once did a 3 v 1: Me, Muhsanat and Radhiya vs Multazim. We won by 2 points by the way. We also go to the park and play there. We sometimes have a huge race. I remember a time Radhiya dribbled the ball so far ahead that I had to boot it twice to get it all the way back!</p>
<p>This is where we usually play:</p>

<h2>Make special horror movies</h2>
<p>This worked brilliantly. I was the protagonist, looked after by my cousin's Radhiya and Muhasanat's mum, as my dad (who Multazim acted) disappeared. He was actually a stone statue and tried to possess Radhiya and Muhsanat. I ran to them and we gained a pink power and then time travelled to save Multazim. We faced an evil scientist (also Multazim), who was the main antagonist but we heroically defeated him. To be honest, they weren't really horror movies, we just called them that because we weren't allowed to watch real horror movies.</p>

<h2>Make dens</h2>
<p>We always made dens with a bunkbed and blanket and played all kinds of games in them. There was an upper floor of the den just in case anyone got hot in the bottom of the den. We even bought a portable charger to charge our phones, tablets and laptops!</p>
